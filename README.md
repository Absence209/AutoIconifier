# AutoIconifier
A tool to automatically iconify tiles using metadata from the playstation api. Automates the normal functions of tileiconifier with a built-in playstation store search tool to quickly find the games' artwork and metadata to add to your start menu.

# Usage
1. Download the stable v2.0 release from the releases page.
1. Run the .exe file
1. The first run might take up to 10 seconds
1. In the start menu items box look for your game shortcut, you can also use the search box to narrow the results
1. Click auto-search to automatically search the playstation store using the shortcut filename, if search yields no results you can use the manual search instead.
1. You can also edit the shortcut name itself .
1. Finally click save.
1. A terminal window should popup detailing the entire process and showing errors, if any.
1. Once the window disappears the shortcut has been iconified successfully.
*The shortcut must be pinned to the start menu manually if it wasnt already*
